Alcrete is ready to strike!              Notorious for his bombs,               Alcrete is quick and               relentless, however he is                limited by the bounds of                the game.  He seems to be                trying to attack you               through words, but be                swift! Take too long, and                it will create an opening                for him to throw a bomb.                Good luck, Rosebloom!
